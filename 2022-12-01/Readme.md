# Nexient DSO Dojo Task - 2022-11-03
See the local [pdf](./2022-12-01_exer.pdf) file an for overview of the task.

## DR;TL
<something>

## Goal
Use my Udemy course to learn enough about:
* lambda (3 lambas in 3 different languages)
* queues
* dynamodb
* api gateway
* serverless framework (maybe)
* AWS Code*
    * I may supplement with my other Udemy course on AWS Code*

and deploy these all with Terraform in a pipeline (in aws pulled from github, or github action)

Although, it is possible to use AWS Code, I might want to stick to GHA, to get a little more practice with it (or not, code pipeline isn't that hard eitehr.)

**NOTE:**
**Serverless Udemy course suggests going through ch 20 & 21 to refresh fundamentals before starting section 2.**
